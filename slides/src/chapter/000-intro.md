## Why rust

- No undefined behavior [...], including **memory safety** and the **absence of data races**.
- **Stricter type system** for further reduction of logic errors.
- A clear distinction between **safe and `unsafe`** code.
- **Featureful** language [...]
- Extensive freestanding **standard library** [...]
- Integrated out of the box **tooling** [...]

Overall, Rust is a language that has successfully leveraged decades of experience from system programming languages as well as functional ones [...] [(source)](https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1023)

>  Rust is an intriguing language. It closely resembles C++ in many ways, hitting all the right notes [...]. [...] it also has the potential to solve some of the most vexing issues that plague C++ projects [...].

> Rust provides memory safety guarantees [...] and runtime checks to ensure that memory accesses are valid. This safety is achieved while providing equivalent performance to C and C++.

>  For developers, Rust offers the performance of older languages like C++ with a heavier focus on code safety. Today, there are hundreds of developers at Facebook writing millions of lines of Rust code.
